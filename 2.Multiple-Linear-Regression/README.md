# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

_**Multiple linear regression (MLR)**_, also known simply as _**multiple regression**_, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.
- The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the _**explanatory (independent)**_ variables and _**response (dependent)**_ variables. 
- Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.


Multiple Linear Regression differs from Multivariate Regression. Multivariate Regression is a method used to measure the degree at which more than one independent variable (predictors) and more than one dependent variable (responses), are linearly related. The method is broadly used to predict the behavior of the response variables associated to changes in the predictor variables, once a desired degree of relation has been established.

## Formula and Calculation of Multiple Linear Regression
_yi = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + ... + βpXip + ϵ
where, for i=n observations:
- _yi_ = dependent variable
- _xi_ = explanatory variables (independent variables)
- _β0_ = y-intercept
- _βp_ = slope coeficient for each explanatory variable
- ϵ = the model's error term (also known as the residuals)
