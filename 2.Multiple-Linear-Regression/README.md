# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

_**Multiple linear regression (MLR)**_, also known simply as _**multiple regression**_, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.
- The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the _**explanatory (independent)**_ variables and _**response (dependent)**_ variable. 
- Multiple regression is an extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.

Multiple Linear Regression differs from Multivariate Regression. Multivariate Regression is a method used to measure the degree at which more than one independent variable (predictors) and more than one dependent variable (responses), are linearly related. The method is broadly used to predict the behavior of the response variables associated to changes in the predictor variables, once a desired degree of relation has been established.

## Formula and Calculation of Multiple Linear Regression
_y<sub>i</sub> = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>x<sub>i1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>x<sub>i2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>x<sub>i3</sub> + ... + β<sub>p</sub>x<sub>ip</sub> + ϵ_

where, for i=n observations:
- _y<sub>i</sub>_ = dependent variable
- _x<sub>i</sub>_ = explanatory variables (independent variables)
- _β<sub>0</sub>_ = y-intercept
- _β<sub>p</sub>_ = slope coeficient for each explanatory variable
- ϵ = the model's error term (also known as the residuals)

## What does it mean for a multiple regression to be linear?
In multiple linear regression, the model calculates the line of best fit that minimizes the variances of each of the variables included as it relates to the dependent variable. Because it fits a line, it is a linear model. There are also non-linear regression models involving multiple variables, such as logistic regression, quadratic regression, and probit models.
