# Machine Learning by Stanford University | Coursera
[Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng)'s Machine Learning course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Includes lecture notes organized by weekly topics. I highly recommend taking this course if you are interested about Machine Learning. Andrew Ng is an excellent professor and the course has amazing content!
