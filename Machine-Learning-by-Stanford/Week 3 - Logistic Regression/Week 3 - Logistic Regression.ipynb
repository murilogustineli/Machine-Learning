    "# Machine Learning: Week 3 - Logistic Regression\n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "Now we are switching from regression problems to classification problems. Don’t be confused by the name “Logistic Regression”; it is named that way for historical reasons and is actually an approach to classification problems, not regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "Instead of our output vector y being a continuous range of values, it will only be 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "y\\in \\{0,1\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $0$ is usually taken as the **“negative class”** and $1$ as the **“positive class”**, but you are free to assign any representation to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re only doing two classes for now, called a _**“Binary Classification Problem”**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. This method doesn’t work well because classification is not actually a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $x^{(i)}$ may be some features of a piece of email, and $y$ may be $1$ if it is a piece of spam mail, and $0$ otherwise. Hence, $y\\in \\{0,1\\}$. $0$ is called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols \"&#8722;” and “&#43;” Given $x^{(i)}$, the corresponding $y^{(i)}$ is also called the label for the training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Representation\n",
    "Our hypothesis should satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "0\\leqslant h_\\theta(x) \\leqslant 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new form uses the **“Sigmoid Function”**, also called the **“Logistic Function”:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![sigmoidFunction](./Week3_Images/SigmoidFunction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $g(z)$, shown here, maps any real number to the $(0, 1)$ interval, making it useful for transforming an arbitrary-valued function into a function better suited for classification. Try playing with an interactive plot of sigmoid function: (https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bgontvxotm).\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with our old hypothesis (linear regression), except that we want to restrict the range to $0$ and $1$. This is accomplished by plugging $\\theta^Tx$ into the Logistic Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$h_\\theta(x)$ will give us the probability that our output is $1$. For example, $h_\\theta(x)=0.7$ gives us the probability of $70\\%$ that our output is $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "h_{\\theta }( x) =P( y=1|x;\\theta ) =1-P( y=0|x;\\theta )\\\\\n",
    "P( y=0|x;\\theta ) +P( y=1|x;\\theta ) =1\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Boundary\n",
    "In order to get our discrete 0 or 1 classification, we can translate the output of the hypothesis function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "h_{\\theta }( x) \\geqslant 0.5\\rightarrow y=1\\\\\n",
    "h_{\\theta }( x) \\ < 0.5\\rightarrow y=0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The way our logistic function g behaves is that when its input is greater than or equal to zero, its output is greater than or equal to 0.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "g( z) \\geqslant 0.5\\\\\n",
    "when\\ z\\geqslant 0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "z=0,\\ e^{0} =1\\Longrightarrow g( z) =\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "z\\rightarrow \\infty ,e^{-\\infty }\\rightarrow 0\\Longrightarrow g( z) =1\\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "z\\rightarrow -\\infty ,\\ e^{\\infty }\\rightarrow \\infty \\Longrightarrow g( z) =0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if our input to $g$ is $\\theta^TX$, then that means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "h_{\\theta }( x) \\ =\\ g\\left( \\theta ^{T} X\\right) \\geqslant 0.5\\\\\n",
    "when\\ \\ \\theta ^{T} X\\geqslant 0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these statements we can now say:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "\\theta ^{T} X\\geqslant 0\\Longrightarrow y=1\\ \\\\\n",
    "\\theta ^{T} X< 0\\Longrightarrow y=0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is the line that separates the area where $y = 0$ and where $y = 1$. It is created by our hypothesis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\theta =\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "5\\\\\n",
    "-1\\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "h_{\\theta }( x) =\\theta _{0} +\\theta _{1} x_{1} +\\theta _{2} x_{2} +...+\\theta _{n} x_{n}\\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "y=1\\ \\ if\\ \\ 5+( -1) x_{1} +0x_{2} \\geqslant 0\\\\\n",
    "5-x_{1} \\geqslant 0\\\\\n",
    "-x_{1} \\geqslant -5\\\\\n",
    "x_{1} \\leqslant 5\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our decision boundary is a straight vertical line placed on the graph where $x1 = 5$, and everything to the left of that denotes $y = 1$, while everything to the right denotes $y = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the input to the sigmoid function $g(z)$ (e.g. $\\theta^TX$) doesn’t need to be linear, and could be a function that describes a circle (e.g. $z=\\theta_0+\\theta_1x^{2}_1+\\theta_2x^{2}_2$) or any shape to fit our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost Function\n",
    "We cannot use the same cost function that we use for linear regression because the Logistic Function will cause the output to be wavy, causing many local optima. In other words, it will not be a convex function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, our cost function for logistic regression looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    " \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "J( \\theta ) =\\frac{1}{m}\\sum _{i=1}^{m} Cost\\left( h_{\\theta }\\left( x^{( i)}\\right) ,y^{( i)}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "Cost( h_{\\theta }( x) ,y) =-log( h_{\\theta }( x)) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ if\\ \\ y=1\\\\\n",
    "Cost( h_{\\theta }( x) ,y) =-log( 1-h_{\\theta }( x)) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ if\\ \\ y=0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![sigmoidFunction](./Week3_Images/cost1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when $y = 0$, we get the following plot for $J(\\theta)$ vs $h_\\theta (x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "![sigmoidFunction](./Week3_Images/cost2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "Cost( h_{\\theta }( x) ,y) =0\\ \\ if\\ \\ h_{\\theta }( x) =y\\\\\n",
    "Cost( h_{\\theta }( x) ,y)\\rightarrow \\infty \\ \\ if\\ \\ y=0\\ \\ and\\ \\ h_{\\theta }( x)\\rightarrow 1\\\\\n",
    "Cost( h_{\\theta }( x) ,y)\\rightarrow \\infty \\ \\ if\\ \\ y=1\\ \\ and\\ \\ h_{\\theta }( x)\\rightarrow 0\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If our correct answer $y$ is $0$, then the cost function will be $0$ if our hypothesis function also outputs $0$. If our hypothesis approaches $1$, then the cost function will approach infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our correct answer $y$ is $1$, then the cost function will be $0$ if our hypothesis function outputs $1$. If our hypothesis approaches $0$, then the cost function will approach infinity.\n",
    "\n",

    "We can compress our cost function's two conditional cases into one case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\n",
    "Cost( h_{\\theta }( x) ,y) =-y\\ log( h_{\\theta }( x)) -( 1-y) log( 1-h_{\\theta }( x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when y is equal to 1, then the second term $( 1-y) log( 1-h_{\\theta }( x))$ will be zero and will not affect the result. If y is equal to 0, then the first term $-y\\ log( h_{\\theta }( x))$ will be zero and will not affect the result.\n",
