# Week 1
## Introduction
Welcome to Machine Learning! This week, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data â€” without being explicitly programmed.

We are going to start by covering linear regression with one variable. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.
